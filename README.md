## Website Logic

### Bot detection
* Before sending your clicks to server, it will check how much clicks you performed for the past 30 seconds.
* If you accumulated more than 800 clicks for the past 30 seconds, it will increment the variable `sequential_max_pops`.
* If you did not accumulate more than 800 clicks even once, the `sequential_max_pops` will reset to 0.
* If the variable `sequential_max_pops` reaches 10, you will be given a `bot = true` cookie and the cat eyes will light up. The cookie lasts for 12 hours.
* While the `bot = true` cookie in place, it will ignore sending your clicks to server.
* You may clear the website cookies to remove the bot status.

### Submitting clicks
* Sends your clicks to server every 30 seconds (Accepts maximum of 800 clicks).
* Sending additional requests within the 30 seconds cooldown will trigger the rate limiter, which responds with HTTP status code 429.
* You can't bypass the rate limiter by using different tab, browser, or even device that uses the same public IP address.
